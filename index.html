                Gawr Gura is an English Virtual YouTuber associated with hololive, debuting as part of its English (EN) branch first generation of VTubers alongside Ninomae Ina'nis, Takanashi Kiara, Watson Amelia and Mori Calliope.
                Gura is friendly and readily likeable, and often amuses her viewers with foolish antics. She has no sense of direction, often misspells and mispronounces words, has trouble remembering her own age, and consistently fails to solve basic math problems, leading viewers to affectionately call her a "dum shark". Memorably, one viewer declared that "Gura has a heart of gold and a head of bone."

                Watson Amelia is an English Virtual YouTuber associated with hololive, debuting as part of its English (EN) branch first generation of VTubers alongside Ninomae Ina'nis, Takanashi Kiara, Mori Calliope and Gawr Gura.
                Personality
                Amelia is a rather eccentric girl who is often seen mingling or teasing her fellow holoMyth members. She is usually kind, supportive, and sweet as shown when she frequently watches her fellow members' streams and often willingly helps Gura in Minecraft. However Amelia also likes to joke around with the other members and sometimes even doing lewd remarks such as naming one of her mines in Minecraft "Gura's Backdoor."
